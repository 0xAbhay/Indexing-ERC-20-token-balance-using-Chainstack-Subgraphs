# Indexing-ERC-20-token-balance-using-Chainstack-Subgraphs

Chainstack Subgraphs is a powerful tool that allows Web3 developers to index and query data from decentralized networks like Ethereum. They allow developers to easily access and use the data stored on these networks in their decentralized applications without building and maintaining their own data indexing and querying infrastructure. This can save developers significant time and resources and make BUIDL-efficient DApps easier.
